You are tasked with extracting key information from a scientific paper PDF and generating a JSON structure for a slideshow presentation. The goal is to create a concise summary that can be easily converted into slides, with the level of simplification adjustable based on the user's preference.

First, you will be provided with the content of the PDF:

{{PDF_CONTENT}}

You will also receive a simplification level, which is a number between 1 and 10:

<simplification_level>
{{SIMPLIFICATION_LEVEL}}
</simplification_level>

The simplification level determines how much you should condense and simplify the information. 
A level of 1 means minimal simplification (most detailed), 
while a level of 10 means maximum simplification (very concise).

Your task is to:
1. Read through the PDF content.
2. Extract relevant information for each field in the JSON structure.
3. Summarize the information based on the given simplification level.
4. **Ensure that exactly three charts are included** in the `"CHARTS"` array.

The JSON structure **must** contain the following fields:

```json
{
  "Title": "",
  "AUTHOR_NAMES": [],
  "PAPER_PMID": "",
  "PAPER_DOI": "",
  "Background_Info": "",
  "Patient_Quote": "",
  "Patient_Name": "",
  "AIMS": [],
  "Methods": "",
  "Findings": [],
  "Conclusion": "",
  "CHARTS": []
}

The Required Fields

    Title: Paper title
    AUTHOR_NAMES: List of author names
    PAPER_PMID: The paper’s PMID
    PAPER_DOI: The paper’s DOI
    Background_Info: A condensed background
    Patient_Quote: A short patient quote
    Patient_Name: Name or identifier for the patient
    AIMS: List of aims or research questions
    Methods: Short description of methods
    Findings: List of main findings
    Conclusion: Main conclusion
    CHARTS: Exactly three chart objects. (See instructions below.)

The CHARTS Array

You must include exactly three chart objects in the "CHARTS" array. For each chart, add an object with the following structure:

{
  "chart_type": "donut" | "patient_count" | "comparison_bars" | "trend_line" | "stacked_percentage",
  "chart_title": "",
  "data": {}
}

Within "data", include the key-value pairs needed for each chart type. For example:

    Donut Chart:

{
  "chart_type": "donut",
  "chart_title": "Prevalence of Serum AFP in patients with chronic hepatitis C",
  "data": {
    "percentage": 23
  }
}

Patient Count Visualization:

{
  "chart_type": "patient_count",
  "chart_title": "U.S. patients with CHC included",
  "data": {
    "count": 357
  }
}

Comparison Bars:

{
  "chart_type": "comparison_bars",
  "chart_title": "Response Rates by Treatment Group",
  "data": {
    "values": [75, 45, 32, 21],
    "labels": ["Group A", "Group B", "Group C", "Group D"]
  }
}

Trend Line:

{
  "chart_type": "trend_line",
  "chart_title": "Patient Enrollment Over Time",
  "data": {
    "values": [10, 15, 25, 20, 30, 35, 28],
    "dates": ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul"]
  }
}

Stacked Percentage:

    {
      "chart_type": "stacked_percentage",
      "chart_title": "Treatment Response Distribution",
      "data": {
        "categories": ["Complete Response", "Partial Response", "Stable", "Progressive"],
        "percentages": [35, 25, 20, 20]
      }
    }

    Ensure that all three charts are relevant and enhance the presentation. If a particular chart type is not applicable, choose another type that best represents the data.

You must place your JSON output inside <json_output> tags. Before providing the JSON, briefly explain your thought process and any challenges you encountered in a <scratchpad> section.

Example Output (for a mid-level simplification, say level 5) could look like:

{
  "Title": "Effects of Exercise on Cardiovascular Health",
  "AUTHOR_NAMES": ["J. Smith", "A. Johnson", "M. Lee"],
  "PAPER_PMID": "12345678",
  "PAPER_DOI": "10.1234/abcd.5678",
  "Background_Info": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death...",
  "Patient_Quote": "I feel healthier and my heart condition improved.",
  "Patient_Name": "John Doe",
  "AIMS": [
    "Identify the effects of exercise on cardiovascular health",
    "Determine the optimal exercise duration"
  ],
  "Methods": "Randomized controlled trial with 500 participants...",
  "Findings": [
    "High-intensity exercise had the most benefit",
    "At least 30 minutes/day is recommended",
    "Mixed routines outperformed single-type routines"
  ],
  "Conclusion": "Regular exercise is key for improving cardiovascular outcomes.",
  "CHARTS": [
    {
      "chart_type": "donut",
      "chart_title": "Proportion of High-Intensity Exercisers",
      "data": {
        "percentage": 40
      }
    },
    {
      "chart_type": "trend_line",
      "chart_title": "Enrollment Over Time",
      "data": {
        "values": [50, 80, 120, 200, 300, 450, 500],
        "dates": ["Week 1", "Week 2", "Week 3", "Week 4", "Week 5", "Week 6", "Week 7"]
      }
    },
    {
      "chart_type": "comparison_bars",
      "chart_title": "Response Rates by Treatment Group",
      "data": {
        "values": [75, 45, 32, 21],
        "labels": ["Group A", "Group B", "Group C", "Group D"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
